	<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
	<p>
		Jennifer and I (Kagen) found Crepes during one of our road trips, and
		felt we couldnâ€™t pass up bringing this cuisine to the Tri-Cities. After
		months of researching the best recipes, griddles, and coffees we finally
		found our location in the historic heart of Richland; The Uptown!
	</p>
	<p>
		Our dream became a reality with the support of our family and friends,
		and a growing number Tri-Citians passionate about supporting our small
		business. We opened Kagen Coffee and Crepes (K1) at the Uptown in
		October 2016. Visit our newest locations Kagen Coffee and Bistro (K2) at
		Tri-Cities Research District and Kagen Coffee and Crepes at PNNL (K3).

		Keep following us here, Facebook, and Instagram to see our future growth
		plans!
