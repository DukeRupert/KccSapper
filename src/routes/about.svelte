	<h1>OUR STORY</h1>
	<p>
			Families and friends need a place to gather.
			A place to visit, catch up and simply enjoy life together. 
			At KCC we believe in togetherness and community. 
			My familyâ€™s best conversations growing up happened
			around a table while snacking on tasty food. 
	</p>
	<p>
			When my wife and I would travel our favorite thing to do was visit crepe shops. 
			It was then that we realized what we wanted to create for our community - 
			a gathering place. A fun place to visit a friend, a quiet place to do homework, a warm place to 
			meet up with your small group. 
			
			Here, we bring you our heart and passion through our love of crepes, coffee, 
			locally sourced ciders and wine. So come on down, order a crepe and start making memories. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Keep following us here, Facebook, and Instagram to see our future growth
		plans!
